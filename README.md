# Angular DICOM service
This DICOM parser/viewer is a prototype / proof of concept. It is a ES5 Javascript library wrapped in an Angular 1.x factory and directive to allow parsing of DICOM P1-10 headers and WebGL/Canvas projection.

**This is a legacy library due to limitations in parsing only some of the dataset types I needed: Big & little endianness is handled, but not jpeg, pdf or other wrappers. Use [ng-dicom](https://github.com/Dercetech/ng-dicom) in case you want to get started as it handles way more wrappers.

## Quick start
Don't start with this project. I only keep it as a cheat-sheet for further DICOM work. Use [ng-dicom](https://github.com/Dercetech/ng-dicom) in case you want to get started.
